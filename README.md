# Quiz-App
The Quiz App is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to test their knowledge on various topics. The home page features a user details section with a logo, welcome note, name text box, and enter button, along with a category section for selecting quiz topics like Pipes and Cisterns, Probability, Problems on Age, and Profit and Loss.

Once a category is selected, the quiz page displays 10 questions with four answer options each. A timer is shown in the top left corner, and the current score is displayed in the top right corner. Users can navigate through the questions using the next question button.

The result page shows the participant's name, total time taken, total number of questions, number of attempted questions, correct answers, wrong answers, and the score percentage. Users can choose to start the quiz again or return to the home page.
